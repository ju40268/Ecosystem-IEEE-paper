\section{INTRODUCTION}

(What are PII, identity, and identity theft)
 Personally identifiable information (PII) is any data that could potentially be used to recognize a particular person, and it's commonly used in both physical and cybersecurity field to perform personal authentication. Identity theft implies a fradulent acquisition and usage without permission of a person's PII. Modern authentication process usually requires collection of PIIs and increase the risk of exposure to identity theft and fraud criminals.

(Why is identity theft important) In 2017, the number of identity fraud victims increased by 8\% rising to 16.7 million U.S. consumers. Fraudsters stole from 1.3 million more victims in 2017 stealing 16.8 billion from U.S. consumers. More intelligent and comprehensive approach should be provided to thwart the collection of identity attributes to be compromised. 

(How can we prevent identity theft by understating the identity ecosystem)
In order to model the identity ecosystem, the initiative approach is to analyze the components from both cyber and physical aspects. Modern society introduces seamlessly merge of cyber world for both online and offline attributes. Examples of on-line attributes are one’s social media accounts, on-line shopping patterns, passwords, and email accounts. Off-line attributes are those related to the physical world such as bank accounts, credit and debit cards, Social Security Number, and one’s physical characteristics. We can further classify every attribute in person, device, organization categories.

(How do we model identity ecosystem)
The UT CID Identity Ecosystem developed at the Center for Identity (CID) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin has constructed a graph-based model of people, devices,
and organizations. It models the relation as a Bayesian Network, performs interference for possible sources of breaches and cost if the source is compromised.
It provides a framework for understanding the value, risk and mutual relationships for pairs of PIIs. Each vertex represents an attribute whereas edges in-between implies the relationship.

(Where do we get the data for identity ecosystem? ITAP)
For data source of ecosystem, The Identity Threat Assessment and Prediction (ITAP) project is leveraged. ITAP is our endeavor focused on gathering identity theft information from such news stories, structuring this information, analyzing it, and discovering trends and characteristics, which extract data from two distinct source, either from RSS feed monitoring or from Google Alert.

(How do we map the data from ITAP to the ecosystem model. [Not Sure])

(Explanation on the paper structure)
The remainder of this article is structured as follow. Section II elaborates on the importance of statistical analysis on Ecosystem tool and set of measurement to be included. Section III presents a comprehensive evaluation and takeaways from the result. Section IV includes the related work of the identity ecosystem, identity theft, and government report. Section V concludes the research and gives insights for future works.


\section{Stats Based on Ecosystem}
(More details on Ecosystem) We have designed and implemented the Identity Ecosystem at the Center for Identity at the University of Texas at Austin as a valuable tool that models identity liaison, analyzes identity frauds and breaches, and answers several questions about identity risk management. It models identity attributes in a probabilistic model, and performs Bayesian Network-based inference to determine the posterior effects on each attribute. It map the individual identity attribute as node whereas edges in-between implies various type of connection.
Each vertex includes different properties such as type of node, risk of exposure, and intrinsic monetary value. The Ecosystem Graphical User Interface (GUI) represents each color and size based on properties independently. Figure 1 shows an example visualization that the nodes are colored based on their liability value and are sized based on their risk of exposure.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic1.png}
  \caption{A snapshot showing Ecosystem attribute graph}
  \label{fig:pic1}
\end{figure}

(What types of stats do we consider and Why is it useful to have stats based on ecosystem)
Based on current Ecosystem framework, it can simplify the model into directed graphs with node attributes and weighted edges. We then focus on three statistical indexes on the given dataset: (1) Bar, Pie, Distribution chart based on node or edge value (2) Centrality measurement including node specific in, out-degree centrality, betweeness centrality, and closeness centrality. (3) Strongly  connected  component of nodes for identifying clusters. Based on the result, the research question we seek to answer is that "Among a graph-based network of identity, what are the underlying characteristics? Are they group as a cluster? If so, what's the isolated ones and connected ones?". We would also want to answer "Inside the network, which node is the one with most authority over the whole, meanwhile which node serves as a broadcaster for every other nodes to flow through the information?". We can further inspect possible breaches with more local attributes as in the cluster, and observe the flow inside network modeling the real-world information movement. This conclude the importance for analyzing the statistical distribution for node values and centrality measurement on Ecosystem.

\section{Statistical Charts}
We present sets of mathematical formula and statistical chart visualization in this section. The data source is from ITAP on Ecosystem, which contains 627 node attributes in total. We divide the analysis based on edge or node specific properties. We represent the Identity Ecosystem as a graph $G(V, E)$ consisting of N attributes $A_{1}$, ...,$A_{N}$ and a set of directed edges as a tuple
$e_{ij} = \langle i, j \rangle$ where $A_{i}$
is the originating node and $A_{j}$
is the target node such that $1 \leq i, j \leq N$. Each edge $e_{ij}$ represents a possible path by which $A_{j}$ can be breached given that $A_{i}$ is breached.

\subsection{Statistical charts based on edges}
We implement the pie chart to observe the percentage for nodes with/without outgoing edges or with/without incoming edges as shown in Figure 2. We can observe that a large portion of the nodes is not connected. In fact, 65\% nodes among whole are fully isolated as terms of without any inbound or outbound connections. Only a small portion is considered to be as a breach or compromised, which are vulnerable to the theft, and should make effort to protect those. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=5cm]{pic2.png}
  \caption{A snapshot showing Pie chart for percentage of nodes with/without in/out degree}
  \label{fig:pic2}
\end{figure}

%  The degree centrality of node i is defined as $Centrality^{Degree}_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{n} e_{ij}$ if there exist a edge from $A_{j}$ to $A_{i}$. 
Furthermore, we inspect the nodes with both in, out degree centrality measurement. Degree centrality equals the number of ties that a vertex has with other vertices. The equation for this measure is as follows, where $d(v_{i})$is the degree of $v_{i}$: 

\begin{equation}
C_{D} = d(v_{i})
\label{P}
\end{equation}

How many direct, ‘one hop’ connections each node has to other nodes within the network. From the result, it could be used to find very connected individuals, popular individuals, individuals who are likely to hold most information or individuals who can quickly connect with the wider network. 

As shown in Figure 3. It presents the top 10 PIIs in descending order with count amount. We could conclude that the attributes most likely to being acquired are Name, Credit Card Information, Date of Birth. Also, the attributes most tended to spread across the network are Customer Database, Password, Email address. Also in Figure 4, It presents the top 10 PIIs in descending order with a sum of weight on the edges, which yields the result for Name, Address, SSN for most possible compromised attributes, while Customer Database, Patient Database, User Credential are widely spread.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical charts based on nodes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Distribution Chart based on node risk and value
\end{itemize}

We calculate the distribution based on risk and value on each attributes to better inspect the how the underlying trend for all properties. Figure 5 gives a snapshot for distribution chart for node value with interval size 1000,00 and  Figure 6 for node risk with size 0.001.

  \caption{Distribution chart based on node risk with interval size as 0.001}
  \label{fig:node_risk_distribution}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Scatter plot on Closeness v.s. Betweenness Centrality
\end{itemize}

Freeman (Cite) developed a set of measures for centrality based on betweenness. Later on Freeman (Cite) proposed four core criteras, which developed into degree, closeness, betweenness , and eigenvector centrality. We further leverage the concept of closeness and betweenness centrality to investigate Ecosystem graph.

\textbf{Closeness Centrality}
 It emphasize how close a vertex is to all other vertices in the topology -- the distance of a vertex to all others in the network by focusing on the geodesic measurement from each vertex to all others. To be more specific, it calculates the shortest path between all nodes and assigns each node a score based on its sum of shortest paths. According to Yin et al. (Cite), closeness is a evaluation for "how long it will take information to spread from a given vertex to others in the network" (Cite), which help find the individuals who are best placed to reach or be reached, and thus influence the entire network most efficiently. Also according to Freidkin(Cite), it represents the independence in the sense that they do not need to seek information from other more peripheral actors.
This yields the equation as follows, $C_{c}(v_{i})$ stands for the closeness centrality based on vertex $i$ and $shortest(v_{i},v_{j})$ is the shortest path between two vertices:
\begin{equation}
C_{c}(v_{i}) = \sum_{j = 1}^{n} \frac{1}{shortest(v_{i}, v_{j})}
\label{C}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Betweenness Centrality}
Betweenness centrality serves as an alternative concept of centrality focusing on control over the connections between other pairs of vertices. It does this by identifying all the shortest paths and then aggregating how many times each node lies on one. Denoted by $\alpha (i, j)$ the number of different shortest $\langle i, j \rangle$ paths, and by $\alpha (i, u, j)$ indicates how many times the shortest path flow through $v$, which means paths containing vertex $u$ as the inner node that $ u \neq i, j$. This gives the equation as below:
\begin{equation}
C_{B}(u) = \sum_{i \neq j \neq u}^{} \frac{\alpha (i, u, j) }{\alpha (i, j)}
\label{C}
\end{equation}

Betweenness centrality recognizes nodes who act as 'bridges' among whole and assessing the individuals who determine the flow around a system. Betweenness serves as a powerful characteristic for communication dynamics -- a high betweenness index could imply someone regulates collaboration in-between, holds authority over, disparates clusters; or infers possibly locates on the periphery of diverse clusters.

Following the centrality concept mentioned above, we calculate and introduce the scatter plot of x-axis revealing betweenness whereas y-axis for closeness indexes.  It could further be splitted into four quadrants based on combination of high, low values and on x, y axis. Denote betweeness for authority(A) and closeness for broadcaster(B), figure 5 shows the graph with blue dots represent high A and high B, orange for low A and low B, green for low A and High B, finally red as High A and low B. We can infer from the graph that most of the data points aggregate on third quadrant, and there are only several sparse distribution on points with both high betweeness and closeness centrality. It then serves as a our concern for analysis -- the attributes hold high authority and act as broadcasters in the network. If evaluated using Ecosystem model, these could be asserted as attributes that will rapidly jeopardize the remaining sub-network if already exposed, and fluctuate, boost the information flow inside the system efficiently.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=6cm]{scatterplot.png}
  \caption{Scatter plot with x-axis showing betweeness and y-axis for closeness centrality}
  \label{fig:pic2}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, we extract top 10 elements with highest closeness centrality as Figure 8 and betweeness as Figure 9.

\subsection{Strongly Connected Component}
Based on previous knowledge, large portion of nodes are isolated. From those with connections, we further identify attributes that are mutually coupled among themselves, which we defined it as a 'cluster'. Clusters serve as subsets that are dangerous source for breaches, can quickly jeopardize other members in the group and confine the flow inside sub-network. 
We propose the cluster to be a Strongly Connected Component (SCC) in the graph theory. A SCC of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ is a maximal set of vertices $U \subseteq V$ such that for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in $U$, we holds for both $u \mapsto v$ and $v \mapsto u$ (Cite), where $u \mapsto v$ means there is a directed path from u to v. Tarjan's classic serial algorithm for detection of SCCs runs linearly with respect to the number of edges and uses depth-first search. We apply the Tarjan's algorithm to compute the clusters and represent the result in Table 1.
